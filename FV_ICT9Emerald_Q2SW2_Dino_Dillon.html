        <td style="color: yellow">Although stocky and fairly compact, this breed has thick boning and is quite muscular. The entire Bombay is rounded. The roundness of the head extends to the tips of the ears, the eyes, the chin, and even the feet. Younger Bombays are energetic, inquisitive cats who rapidly adjust to change. They enjoy observing their surroundings at any age, and their favorite spot is frequently a window that allows them to do so. These cats are incredibly affectionate and occasionally try to get their parents to spend time with them.</td>
